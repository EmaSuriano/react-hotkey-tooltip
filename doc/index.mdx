# Introduction

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <h1>React Hotkey Tooltip</h1> 
  <img src={logo} style={{width: '200px'}} alt="React Hotkey Tooltip logo" />
</div>


## Why you should use it?

When working with hotkeys/shorcuts in a React application, it's normal to have these kind of problems:
* Declared hotkeys are only accesible inside a specific component (not globally).
* Must take care of the hotkeys manually throughout the life cycle (e.g. remove the hotkey when the component is unmount).
* Have to provide a way so the user can see all the hotkeys on the screen.

This library helps you by declaring **global hotkeys** that automatically will be **updated by any life cycle** of the component and show a **tooltip with its hotkey** ‚ú®

## Built with

Why mess up with `document.addEventListener` or positioning/styling tooltips if there are a lot of open source libraries that can do that for me. This are the chosen ones!

* [mousetrap](https://github.com/ccampbell/mousetrap): to bind and unbind hotkeys globally üåê
* [react-tippy](https://github.com/tvkhoa/react-tippy): to display beautiful tooltips üòÑ

## Basic Example

By pressing `shift+h` a tooltip will be displayed with the hotkey of the button. Then by pressing `a` it will the `click` event of the button üéâ

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center '}}>
     <HotkeyProvider>
    <Hotkey combination="a" onPress="click">
      <button onClick={() => alert('You have clicked me!')}>Click me using your keyboard!</button>
    </Hotkey>
  </HotkeyProvider>
</div>
